## Bombyx - Real-time Life Cycle Assessment parametric tool for calculating CO2 impact

### About:
The Bombyx tool is developed as a plugin for Grasshopper based on Rhinoceros and includes an SQL material and component database. Users are able to choose different materials and building systems and quickly modify the buildingâ€™s geometry while continuously receiving the calculated environmental impact in real-time. Designs in Bombyx could be considered as pre-BIM, where user doe not have enough information about the building to make a full BIM model. This is where two different approaches can be taken: top-down and bottom-up. First approach gives the option of selecting several inputs to categorize the building and the bottom-up concept gives users the option of constructing every element of the building from the material selection onwards. Visualization of the results, e.g. colour code indicating how the design performs in relation to a benchmark or optimization potential.

8. installation should look like this (might be different version number at the end) <br/> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19927980/114413038-ed6e2c00-9bad-11eb-9d8d-07b41b6ad560.png)

### Contents:
coming soon to a github near you

### Usage:
coming soon to a github near you

### Examples:
Example files provided on [Food4Rhino](https://www.food4rhino.com/app/bombyx) contain different scenarios like top-down and bottom-up approaches, both with operational energy demand, and few other simple examples.

### Future development plans:
1. Volumetric design stage
2. Better visualization
3. Material suggestions
4. Custom materials input
5. Less bugs

### Known issues:
Sometimes, item selector can get bugged and fastest fix is to use an item selector from [Human](https://www.food4rhino.com/app/human) addon.

### Credits:
Special thanks goes to Prof. Dr. [Guillaume Habert](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Guillaume-Habert) for making the project possible, Dr. [Alexander Hollberg](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alexander-Hollberg) for starting the early project design, Dr. [Alina Galimshina](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alina-Galimshina) for making sure that calculations, units and data are in order, and [Saso Basic](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Saso-Basic) for putting the code together.
